<img src="pitch.png" width="500" height="350">

Remember the Startup Challenge that we had some time ago? Well let's crank it up!

### Overview

Your team will conceptualize two web app startup ideas and applications, focusing on a unique problem.

You can use [this Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qK14oA9yGXFtaGepRByEBg_T0r2IblGUeZTuUw8fdNw/edit#slide=id.g232c0c426ca_0_200) (or create your own) to present your pitch.
[Pitch Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qK14oA9yGXFtaGepRByEBg_T0r2IblGUeZTuUw8fdNw/edit#slide=id.g232c0c426ca_0_200)

Each pitch idea will answer three questions:

1. What does the app do?

1. What problem does the app solve

1. Who is this app for?

You will pitch these ideas to the full cohort and instructors. Afterwards, there will be a vote.

Based on the vote, you will build out both a slide presentation and an application.

\*\*\* Note: Based on feasibility and uniqueness the instructors may choose against the vote.

## You should follow the process below to discover and choose two ideas you will be pitching .

### Phase 1: Problem Identification & Research

**Brainstorming Session:** Each squad brainstorms problems they encounter in daily life or areas where they think technology can make a difference. Encourage them to think broadly - education, health, environment, entertainment, etc.

**Market Research:** Squads use the internet to research if their identified problem already has existing solutions. They should note what current solutions lack and how their idea can fill that gap.

### Phase 2: Concept Development

**App Conceptualization:** Squads define their app idea, focusing on:

- What it does.
- How it stands out from existing solutions.
- Target audience.

### Phase 3: Pitch Preparation

**Pitch Development:** Each squad prepares a 5-minute pitch presentation.

The slide should answer

- What does the app do
- What problem does it solve
- Who is the app for

You can make a copy and use this Slide (or create your own) to present your pitch - [Pitch Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qK14oA9yGXFtaGepRByEBg_T0r2IblGUeZTuUw8fdNw/edit#slide=id.g232c0c426ca_0_200)

The spoken presentation should include:

- Problem and solution.
- Target audience and user personas.
- Key features and user stories.
- Why their app could be successful in the market.

**Rehearsal:** Quick run-through of their presentation to ensure it's within the time limit.

### Phase 4: Final Phase - Pitches

Each squad has 8 minutes to present their startup idea to the class. Choose a representative for your team to present the ideas. Or one representative for each idea. This is not a group presentation where everyone should speak.

Tell us:

- the name of the product
- the persona(s), i.e. the users, for whom you are solving this problem? e.g. "Jon is a student who can't afford to go to college. They need a way to find scholarship options for which they are elgible"
- what problem the product solves
- how you differentiate yourselves from other products
- user stories, what will the user be able to do, specifically with the app.

Good Luck!
